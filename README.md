# Istio Community

Welcome to the Istio community!

This is the starting point for becoming a contributor - improving docs, improving code, giving talks etc.

## Communicating

The [communication](communication.md) page lists communication channels like chat, issues, mailing lists, etc.

For more specific topics, try the component specific directories of this repository.

## Working Groups

Istio is a set of components, each shepherded by dedicated working groups.

A first step to contributing is to pick from the [list of istio working groups](working-groups.md).

## How Can I Help ?

Documentation (like the text you are reading now) can always use improvement!

There's a [list of issues](https://github.com/istio/issues) that should not need deep knowledge of the system.

To dig deeper, read a design doc, e.g. [architecture](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/overview.html#architecture).

There's always code that can be clarified and variables or functions that can be renamed or commented.

There's always a need for more test coverage.
