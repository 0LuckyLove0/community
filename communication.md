# Communication

We have a [Values](https://github.com/istio/istio/blob/master/VALUES.md) document you must read and internalize.

Which includes our adoption of the [CNCF code of conduct].  Here is an excerpt:

> of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect
> all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature
> requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches,
> and other activities._
